The aim of Gut Caretaker: Health Tracker Mobile App for Hospital Sungai Buloh Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients is to enhance the communication between doctor and patient during their consultation. The purpose of the Gut Caretaker is to help the patients play their part in their treatment. Gut Caretaker is a self-management mobile application that enables IBD patients to take control of their lifestyle better by adding their appointment dates, and test results, and tracking their symptoms. Firstly, administrators need to register account for new patients and then set up their health records in their account. Then, the patient can view their health records and rate their symptoms in the given questionnaire. Other than that, the patient also can add their appointments together with their concerns. So, their doctor can not only view their symptoms score over time but also their concerns before the patient himself enters the room. This process helps enhance the communication between patient and doctor as the patient knows their condition very well while the doctor can view the patientâ€™s condition over time in the application.
