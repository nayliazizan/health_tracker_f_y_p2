GUT CARETAKER: HEALTH TRACKER MOBILE APP FOR HOSPITAL SUNGAI BULOH IBD PATIENTS

# INTRODUCTION 
In public hospital specialist clinics with a large patient load, effective patient-doctor communication is essential. My research highlights the need for improved consultation time and accurate patient information for effective diagnoses. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative mobile app that allows patients to provide essential health information before their appointment. The goal of this system is to improve patient-doctor communication and minimise the difficulties that both parties face.

# PROBLEM STATEMENTS 
• MANUAL HEALTH TRACKING 
Patients rely on physical books to record their symptoms, which can be easily lost, leading to a loss of valuable health data and potentially impacting the accuracy of diagnoses. 
• INEFFECTIVE DOCTOR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION 
Time constraints during consultations can result in rushed interactions, limiting the quality of communication and inhibiting patients from expressing their concerns adequately.

# OBJECTIVES 
• To analyse problem of patient’s unorganized record for doctor during appointment 
• To develop health tracking mobile application 
• To evaluate functionality of Gut Caretaker by conducting system and user acceptance testing once it is fully developed

# SYSTEM SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
• Fully developed using FlutterFlow in Dart language. 
• Using Cloud Firestore 
• Developed for Android and iOS mobile.

# SYSTEM FEATURES 
• Patient can manage appointment, view resource, and rate their symptom anytime 
• Doctor can view patient's symptoms over time, and view their concerns 
• Admin can register new patient, enter patient's health record, and update resources for patient's educational purposes

# TESTING & RESULTS 
• UNIT TESTING 
Each module was thoroughly tested to ensure its individual functionality and correctness. 
• SYSTEM TESTING: FUNCTIONAL 
The application successfully met all functional requirements, demonstrating the expected behavior and accurate execution of business processes. 
• SYSTEM TESTING: NON-FUNCTIONAL 
PERFORMANCE 94%, STRESS 90%, and VOLUME 100%

# CONCLUSIONS
• By addressing significant issues with IBD patient healthcare
management, the Gut Caretaker successfully accomplishes
its objectives.
• The application achieves its objectives of developing a
user-centric mobile app with user-friendly interfaces and
modules through extensive testing and development.
• The application can be reliable and accurate thanks to the
effective unit testing and system testing performances, thus
completing the application's objetives.

## Getting Started
